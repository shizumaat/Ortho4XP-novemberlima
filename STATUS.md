## v14.1 fixes (this session, after the default flip)

1. **SPLP seam cliff (user-reported regression) — FIXED, 24 → 0.**
   `nudge_runway_corners_at_seam_junctions` assumed a seam piece is a SMALL
   terrain-pinned stub; a sliced face reaches the tile line from 480 m away, so
   it dragged runway 02/20's threshold 5.4 m off its FAA profile.  Skipped under
   the global slice (`pipeline.py` call site) — seam pins stay truth-hard and the
   solver spreads the drop (cap × 480 m ≫ 5.4 m).
2. **Service roads = road-cap spines (user ruling) — CYXY 300 → 174.**
   Service centerlines are sliced; NARROW faces riding only a truck route
   (width ≤ 25 m) emit `ROLE_SERVICE_JUNCTION` (restores `road_zone`); wide
   pavement crossed by a truck route stays apron.  `grade_graph.build_context`
   adds service lines as SPINES at `SERVICE_ROAD_MAX_GRADE` under the slice
   (longitudinal 4 % solve along the road); `taxi_axes_ll` exports service axes
   at the road cap (was accidentally 1.5 %).
3. **Rect-era test triage**: `test_junction_invariants` + `test_junction_rules`
   skip under `ROUTE_ARC_SPINE` (rect-residue semantics, kept for legacy path).

## What happened this session

1. **Audit of the 1242→2533 doubling** (the old rect-path A/B): NOT worse grading —
   the violation *rate* went DOWN (5.64%→5.11%); the count doubled because the arcs +
   their corner legs were both sliced per-junction → 2.25× constrained pairs
   (sliver faces, dense cut nodes). The metric itself was also off: the CLI
   `check_grade` ran context-free (no axes/routes → no spine/blend/aniso credit).
2. **USER RULING mid-session: with the full spine, disable taxi-RECT creation — the
   spine runs everywhere.** Implemented: `O4_ROUTE_ARC_SPINE=1` now implies the
   curve-native **global slice** (`apply_route_arc_spine` runs at the slice stage;
   pav_union cut once by route+arc ways; rect emit / junction_emit / fillet /
   synthetic-spine / junction_spine all bypassed). `2f828e1`.
3. **Axes sidecar** (`10eb088`): `layout.to_osm` writes `<patch>.axes.json`;
   `tools/check_grade.py` auto-loads it → the standalone CLI now applies the SAME
   within-shape law as the solver/suite. Context-free numbers (1242 etc.) are
   obsolete; compare law-true only.
4. **Solver adaptations** (found via `tools/grade_feasibility_audit.py` — all
   violations were 0-fundamental/all-unenforced, POCS→0):
   * **No dedup for route-arc slice input** — the 3.5 m paint-dedup ate short
     junction connector fragments (481→399), disconnecting spine chains: PHASE A
     froze adjacent route chains up to 2.6 m apart (frozen-spine walls).
   * **`classify_faces` v2** — corridor by geometry (width = area/shared-edge), not
     centerline count; big multi-CL faces are JUNCTION when ≥55% of area is within
     25 m of their centerlines; only true stand/terminal pavement keeps 1 % apron law.
   * **SPINE-YIELD projection** (`route_profile/solve.py`, global-slice only, LAST
     before writeback): most nodes are spine under the slice, so "both-hard =
     genuine step" is wrong; re-project with only truth anchors hard (runway/CIFP,
     tile-seam pins, building seats, groundside pins).

## Scoreboard (law-true `tools/check_grade.py <patch>` with sidecar, within-shape)

| fixture | rect baseline (gate OFF) | v14.0 | **v14.1 (HEAD)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPJC | 198 | 185 | **175 ✓ below** |
| CYXY | 138 | 300 | **174** (1.26× — building seats remain) |
| SPLP | 0 | 24 | **0 ✓ = baseline** |
| HECA | 4138 | 5275 | 5184 ✗ (+4 cross-shape desyncs) |

Open items (named, diagnosed):

- **CYXY 174 vs 138**: building-frontage seat conflicts — pads seated at
  incompatible levels 1–2 m apart (production pins seats; the audit proves a
  compliant field exists if seats could move → the building-FEASIBILITY seat
  solver must pick frontage-compatible levels, or the spine-yield should treat
  each building as a movable FLAT group like the audit does). Worst spots:
  (88,-399), (117,-533) + building-10002, (-243,914).
- **HECA 5184 vs 4138**: not yet dissected (builds clean end-to-end; suspect the
  same building-seat class at scale + 4 cross-shape desyncs).
- **`test_pavement_rests_on_source` red ×3 (CYXY/SPJC/SPLP)** — GENUINE: the
  slice emits every face of the local `pav_union`, which contains area that is
  NOT apt.dat/DSF source (SPLP faces #19/#20: 82k/34k m² at 20-24 % on source —
  pavement over grass in the sim). The rect pipeline separated/dropped that
  area (groundside separation, residue rules). Fix direction: intersect the
  slice input with `source_pavement_union`, or run the groundside/clearance
  separation before the slice. **This is the top JOSM-visible defect.**
- `node_altitudes` are written at 0.1 m resolution — at sub-metre pair distances
  rounding alone can eat the budget; part of the <0.5 %-over tail is noise.

## Where things are

- Wiring: `pipeline.py` (`_global_slice_spine = CURVE_NATIVE_SPINE or
  ROUTE_ARC_SPINE`, slice branch ~line 3360; the old pre-slice hook is gone).
- Gate: `config.ROUTE_ARC_SPINE` (env `O4_ROUTE_ARC_SPINE`, default OFF).
- Solver: `route_profile/solve.py` — `truth_hard` captured pre-freeze; SPINE-YIELD
  block right before `_writeback`.
- Faces: `pavement/global_slice.py::classify_faces` (route-territory rule).
- Sidecar: `layout._write_axes_sidecar` + `tools/check_grade.py::main`.
- Iteration tools (session scratchpad patterns worth recreating): full-build script
  (`build_airport_pavement` → `to_osm` → CLI check); law-true probe = build →
  `verification.taxi_axes_ll/taxi_routes_ll` → `check_grade._check_within_shape`;
  `tools/grade_feasibility_audit.py <ICAO>` classifies fundamental vs unenforced
  (env gates apply — run with `O4_ROUTE_ARC_SPINE=1`).
- Debug: `O4_STEP_DEBUG=1` prints one_solve residuals by node type ("seam" there
  = any base_hard node incl. frozen spine, NOT just tile seams).

## NEXT SESSION

1. **`rests_on_source` fix** (top JOSM-visible defect): stop emitting faces over
   non-source pavement — intersect the slice input with
   `source_pavement_union` (+ runway), or run groundside/clearance separation
   before the slice. Then re-check the invariant ×4.
2. **CYXY building-seat frontage coupling** (174 → ≤138): frontage-compatible
   seat levels in `building_feasibility`, or movable-flat-group buildings in the
   spine-yield projection.
3. **HECA dissection** (rate + audit + forensics — the session-1 playbook) +
   its 4 cross-shape desyncs.
4. Recut SPLP/SPJC compare-target fixtures once v14 geometry settles; re-baseline
   `test_pavement_grade` counts.

Suggested kickoff:
> "Continue V14.1 (STATUS.md + memory pav_skeleton_medial_axis_spine.md):
> route-arc global slice default ON; SPJC 175<198 ✓, SPLP 0 ✓, CYXY 174 vs 138,
> HECA 5184 vs 4138. Fix rests_on_source (slice emits pav_union area that isn't
> apt.dat/DSF source — pavement over grass), then CYXY building seats, then HECA."
