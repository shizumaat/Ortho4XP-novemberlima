"""Groundside (curbside / drop-off / parking) pavement emit.

Pulls roads tagged as airport-access or service highway out of the
OSM cache, lifts them off the DEM, and emits matching curbside
ribbon polygons.  Then prunes orphan junction polygons that are
fully contained inside (or touch only) the groundside ribbon —
those are road-island fragments that don't belong with airside
pavement.

    shape with per-vertex altitudes.

    Per user 2026-04-29: pavement that wraps around the GROUNDSIDE
    of a terminal building (curbside, drop-off, parking) sits at a
    different elevation than the airside apron — at CYXY the
    terminal is cut into the hill so the airside apron is several
    metres lower than the road frontage.  The earlier subtraction
    pass (see ``_terminal_groundside_zone``) keeps the airside
    pavement clean of these strips, but they still belong in the
    output: they should render at local DEM elevation and should
    NOT touch the terminal building footprint (a 0.1 m gap is
    already applied during capture).

    Implementation:
      1. Iterate ``layout._groundside_polys`` (captured during
         ``build_airport_pavement`` immediately before the
         groundside subtraction).
      2. Densify each polygon's exterior to ``densify_step_m`` so
         per-vertex altitudes resolve at the same spatial
         frequency as the boundary ribbon (15 m step → typical
         curbside has 5–10 vertices per side).
      3. Sample DEM at every vertex; emit as ``BuiltShape`` with
         role ``ROLE_GROUNDSIDE_PAVEMENT``, ``node_altitudes`` set,
         and ``altitude``/``altitude_high``/``altitude_low`` left
         None so the OSM emitter writes per-vertex altitude tags.

    pavement (no path through shared vertices to any airside
    rect / runway / terminal).

    Per user 2026-04-29 (CYXY -10111 + -10115): the rect/
    junction tessellator can leave small junction polygons
    sitting next to a groundside polygon when the apt.dat
    row-110 union has a thin strip outside the groundside-
    zone subtraction's perpendicular extent.  Those junctions
    get assigned the airside-flat altitude during the unified
    Laplacian solver (because they were classified as airside
    junctions even though they don't actually touch any
    airside pavement), then they share an edge with the DEM-
    following groundside polygon at a 7 m altitude mismatch —
    X-Plane renders that as a cliff.

    Detection rule:
      A junction is dropped if BOTH:
        1. It shares ≥1 vertex with a
           ``ROLE_GROUNDSIDE_PAVEMENT`` polygon.
        2. It does NOT share any vertex with an airside seed
           shape (runway / primary_parallel / secondary_parallel
           / stub / cross_connector / terminal), whether
           directly or transitively through other junction
           polygons (BFS over junction-junction shared vertices).

      Rationale: a junction between the groundside polygon and
      surrounding terrain is the cliff-creating sliver — drop
      it.  But a junction that legitimately connects an apron
      to a runway or terminal must be kept even if its outer
      edge happens to touch a groundside polygon, otherwise we
      tear a hole in the airside surface (SPJC primary_parallels
      U and M had their short edges become disconnected when
      the simpler rule dropped their connecting junctions).
