"""Taxi/road bridges + tunnel portals + depressed-road segments.

Five emitters:

* ``_emit_tunnel_portals`` — short ramp polygons at tunnel-OSM
  entrance / exit so the road dives under airport pavement.
* ``_scenery_has_bridge_objects`` — DSF-pavement check that gates
  bridge emission (no point emitting bridge polygons if the
  underlying scenery already provides bridge meshes).
* ``_emit_taxi_bridges`` — taxi-over-road bridges.
* ``_emit_underpass_road_approaches`` — road approaches sloping
  down toward an underpass.
* ``_emit_through_airport_depressed_roads`` — road segments
  depressed below airport surface where they cut through.

**All five are gated by ``EMIT_BRIDGES_AND_TUNNELS`` in
``O4_Pavement_Config`` (currently True).**  Each emitter carves
its footprint out of overlapping airside / groundside pavement
before emitting so ``test_no_self_overlap`` stays green.

    """For each tunnel portal (each end of an OSM ``aeroway=*``
    ``tunnel=yes|building_passage`` way), emit the visible road-
    surface structure that transitions outside-DEM elevation down
    to ``apt_elev − tunnel_depth_m`` at the portal:

      1. A flat ``ROLE_RETAINING_WALL`` CAP polygon AT the portal
         node (perpendicular to road direction at portal).  The
         cap's centre line is the portal node — its width spans
         the road (carriageway width + wall_gap on each side),
         its thickness is ``retaining_wall_width_m`` (1 m).
      2. Two flat ``ROLE_RETAINING_WALL`` ARM polygons reaching
         OUTWARD from the cap along the surface roadway, on each
         side of the carriageway.  The arms follow the OSM
         surface road's polyline — multi-segment when the road
         curves.  Arm length adapts to terrain: we first walk up
         to ``arm_max_length_m`` (default 500 m), sample DEM at
         the far end, then truncate the walk so the grade from
         ``apt_elev − tunnel_depth_m`` (portal) up to that DEM
         height never exceeds ``max_ramp_grade``.  Floor at
         ``ramp_min_length_m`` (default 200 m) so a flat road
         still gets a substantial visible approach.
      3. A chain of sloped ``ROLE_TUNNEL_RAMP`` polygons matching
         the surface-road segments under the arms.  Each segment's
         elevation interpolates linearly from
         ``apt_elev − tunnel_depth_m`` at the portal to outside
         DEM at the far end of the walk, in proportion to its
         cumulative distance from the portal.

    Per user 2026-04-29 (SPJC review): the previous geometry put
    the cap PAST the portal INSIDE the airport, with arms going
    AWAY from the tunnel only as far as the OSM way extended
    outside the airport.  That made SPJC's SW tunnel "too short
    and inside the tunnel" because the OSM way ended right at the
    boundary.  Walking the SURFACE road OUTWARD from the OSM
    portal node correctly lands the cap at the tunnel mouth and
    the arms on the highway approach.

    Two-carriageway tunnels (divided highways) cluster by portal-
    node proximity (within ``portal_cluster_dist_m``).  Each
    carriageway in a cluster gets its own arm pair; the caps form
    a perpendicular line across all member portals.

    Boundary coordination: subtract the tunnel-polygon union
    (buffered by ``boundary_clearance_m``, default 1 m which
    exceeds the OSM-emit vertex bucket size of 0.5 m so boundary
    nodes never collapse onto wall nodes) from every
    ``ROLE_BOUNDARY`` shape.

    Returns the number of tunnel PORTALS emitted (each contributing
    1 cap + 2 arm walls + a ramp chain).

    Detection logic (per user 2026-04-29):
      1. Find the DSF for the scenery pack via
         ``O4_DSF_Reader.find_associated_dsf``.
      2. Convert it to text (cached alongside the .dsf as
         ``.dsf.text``) using DSFTool when not already cached.
      3. Walk OBJECT_DEF lines.  Mark a def as a "bridge def" when
         its path matches ``bridge|elevated|viaduct|overpass``
         AND does NOT match ``sign|signage|trafficsign|wall|
         truss|crane`` — KPHX has 3 ``lib/g10/roadsigns/SignBridge
         *.obj`` defs that are road sign gantries, NOT taxi
         bridges, and the exclude regex filters them out.
      4. Walk OBJECT placement lines.  When a placement uses a
         "bridge def" AND its lat/lon lies within
         ``bridge_proximity_m`` of any taxi rect with
         ``is_bridge=True``, return True.

              elevated_edge_twy_B, ...) — many placements within

    Per user 2026-04-29 (KBNA vs KPHX): when the X-Plane scenery
    pack ALREADY contains a 3D taxi-bridge OBJ (detected by
    ``_scenery_has_bridge_objects``, e.g. KBNA's
    ``Objects/KBNA Bridges/KBNA_Bridge_Taxiway-L_*.obj``), the

    skip the wall emission entirely so we don't double up.  When
    the scenery has NO bridge OBJ (KPHX), our emitted walls
    provide the only visible side-face structure.

    No end-cap walls — the bridge's short edges connect to
    adjacent taxis or junctions at apt_elev (the deck continues
    onto the surrounding airport surface), so an end-cap would
    visually block that join.

    Boundary coordination: when a bridge rect lies inside the
    airport boundary (typical at SPJC / KBNA / KPHX), the walls
    are also inside.  The inside-airport portion of (rect ∪
    walls) gets buffered by ``boundary_clearance_m`` (0.5 m) and
    subtracted from each ``ROLE_BOUNDARY`` shape — same pattern
    as ``_emit_tunnel_portals``.

    """For each underpass case (taxi BRIDGE rect or road TUNNEL
    portal), emit a chain of sloped road-following polygons that
    transition the road surface from outside-DEM elevation down
    to ``apt_elev − clearance_depth_m`` near the underpass and
    back up to DEM after.

    Per user 2026-04-29 (KBNA / KPHX taxi-bridge case): without
    these polygons, the patch's mesh under a bridge sits at
    apt_elev (interpolated from the surrounding airport pavement),
    and OSM-tagged roads rendered at DEM elevation by Ortho4XP's
    road layer get buried.  Emitting a chain of road-following
    polygons forces the mesh under the road to step down to a
    height low enough for the road to clear the bridge underside
    (default 8 m below airport surface), then ramp back up to DEM
    away from the airport.

    Algorithm per underpass surface (bridge rect or tunnel portal
    region):

      1. Find OSM road LineStrings that cross the surface's
         footprint (or pass within 5 m of its long edges, for
         tunnel portals where the road just barely touches).
      2. For each crossing road, find the exterior segments
         immediately approaching and departing the surface.
      3. Walk each approach segment in ``ramp_step_m`` (20 m)
         increments, emitting a sloped 4-corner rect per step
         where elevation interpolates between DEM (start) and
         ``apt_elev − clearance_depth_m`` (end).
      4. Inside the underpass surface itself, emit a flat road-
         following polygon at ``apt_elev − clearance_depth_m``.

    Width of every emitted road polygon: ``road_width_m``
    (22 m by default; matches tunnel-ramp width).

    Returns the number of UNDERPASS surfaces processed.

    AND passes under a tagged ``aeroway=*, bridge=yes`` way (or
    is connected via OSM-graph node-sharing to a road that does)
    inside the airport, emit:

      1. A flat road-following polygon along the entire inside-
         boundary stretch at ``apt_elev − depression_depth_m``.
         Subsequent OSM road rendering (Ortho4XP's own road
         layer) sits on top of this flat plate.
      2. At each boundary entry/exit point, a ramp polygon
         OUTSIDE the airport that climbs from the depressed
         level back up to the local DEM, capped at
         ``max_ramp_grade`` (default 4 %).

    Per user 2026-04-29 (KPHX Sky Harbor Blvd): when a road
    passes under multiple airport bridges, the road MUST be
    depressed for its entire inside-airport stretch — not just
    at the bridges.  Two bridges spanning the same continuous
    road imply the road can never come back up between them.
    The general solution: any road that enters the airport
    boundary and crosses any aeroway=bridge inside is treated
    this way, plus any road CONNECTED to it via shared OSM
    nodes within the boundary (so on/off ramps inside the
    airport stay coherent with the main road).

    OSM tags consulted:
      * ``aeroway=*, bridge=yes|viaduct`` — bridge LineStrings
        (the airport surface above the depression).
      * ``highway=*`` (motorway, trunk, primary, secondary,
        tertiary, residential, service + their *_link forms) —
        the road network candidates.
      * ``bridge=yes|viaduct`` on a highway — that road is
        ITSELF a bridge over something else (skip; we're
        looking for the road UNDERNEATH).
      * ``tunnel=yes|building_passage`` on a highway — INCLUDED
        as seeds (the airport-bridge case typically tags the
        under-bridge road segment as building_passage in OSM).
        ``_emit_tunnel_portals`` is told to skip every OSM way
        depressed here so we don't double-emit.

    Boundary coordination: the union of every emitted polygon
    is buffered by ``boundary_clearance_m`` and subtracted from
    each ``ROLE_BOUNDARY`` shape (same pattern as the tunnel
    and taxi-bridge emitters), with NN-resampling of per-vertex
