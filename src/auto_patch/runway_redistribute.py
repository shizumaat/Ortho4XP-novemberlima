"""Redistribute runway-segment altitudes after seam DEM anchors enter
the profile (user 2026-05-19).

Background
----------
``runway_segments.generate_patch_osm`` emits an FAA-compliant runway
profile at the time it runs — anchored by CIFP thresholds, cross-runway
projection anchors, and centerline-crossing reconciliation, all passed
through the parabolic envelope clamp + hard-cap + rate-of-change
gates.  But it knows nothing about tile-boundary seams: the seam
pipeline runs later, identifies which runway vertices sit on integer
lat/lon lines, and pins them HARD to ``dem.alt_strict`` (the raw HGT
pixel — required for cross-tile parity / preserve_boundary).

The old ``runway_regrade`` only adjusted the two threshold corners
when seam altitudes were added.  Interior segment-boundary corners
stayed at their emit-time CIFP values, which meant the runway's
combined profile (post-regrade) was no longer FAA-compliant —
adjacent sub-rects could disagree on grade or curvature at the
shared seam, and the per-surface solver had to paper over the
result.

This module finishes the job the regrade started.  For each runway
pair, it:

  1. Pulls the emit-time profile (``layout._runway_profile_state``)
     — the sample grid + anchor flags + phys-end coordinates +
     blast pad lengths.
  2. Folds every seam vertex on that runway into the sample list as
     an additional ANCHORED sample at its DEM altitude.
  3. Re-runs the same FAA gates the emit step ran
     (``runway_segments.faa_joint_solve``) — envelope clamp + hard
     cap + rate-of-grade-change — so the non-anchored interior
     samples shift to honor the new seam anchors while staying
     FAA-compliant.
  4. Evaluates the new profile at every runway sub-rect's vertex
     position (projected onto the runway axis) and writes back per-
     vertex ``node_altitudes``.  Sub-rects that came in as 4-corner
     canonical sloped rects get converted to ``node_altitudes`` if
     any corner moved away from the canonical ``[H, L, L, H]``
     pattern; otherwise they keep their ``altitude_high``/
     ``altitude_low``.

After this pass, every runway vertex carries an FAA-compliant
altitude derived from the same sample grid + same anchor set + same
gates as the emit-time profile.  Adjacent shapes (junctions, aprons,
taxiways) anchor to the runway-emitted altitudes via shared corners
exactly as before.

Cross-tile parity: deterministic from layout geometry + the seam
DEM samples (which preserve_boundary keeps identical between
neighbouring tiles).  Both tile builds compute the same augmented
sample list and run the same iterative passes, so they converge to
the same profile values at every vertex.

    Why one sample per boundary instead of one per boundary-runway
    vertex (user 2026-05-19): when a runway crosses a tile boundary
    at a shallow angle (e.g. SPLP runway 02/20 is 18° off the
    lon=-77 boundary, slicing diagonally through 148 m of runway
    length), the boundary-runway polygon intersection yields multiple
    vertices fanning across the runway's 45 m width at different
    latitudes.  Each latitude samples a different DEM pixel; on
    rolling terrain, those samples differ by metres even though
    they're all "the same crossing."  Anchoring at the centerline
    crossing gives one FAA-feasible altitude — the value the runway
    actually has where its centerline meets the contour line in the
    real world.
