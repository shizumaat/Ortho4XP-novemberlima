"""Per-surface unified Jacobi elevation solver (user 2026-05-03).

Lifted from ``auto_patch.elevation._solve_pavement_elevations_unified``
(commit ``35db401`` baseline) with three targeted changes that
implement the per-axis grade rule:

1. **Rects (taxi roles) get RING EDGES ONLY — no within-shape spatial
   pairs, plus a cross-section flatness constraint.**  Per user
   2026-05-03 terminology: a rect has two "sloping edges" (parallel
   to ``source_axis``, where slope is allowed at ≤ 1.5 % per metre
   of axial travel) and two "axis-end edges" (perpendicular to
   ``source_axis``, which must be EXACTLY FLAT — zero perpendicular
   delta).  Avoid "short" / "long" — a taxi rect can be wider than
   it is long (e.g. SPJC stub F).  The flatness is enforced as an
   equality constraint group on the two corners at each axis-end
   (``rect_flat_groups``), not a 1.5 %-cap edge.

   No diagonals.  No edges from a rect to a perpendicular runway
   150 m away.  Junction vertices touching a rect must coincide
   with the rect's corners only — no intermediate nodes on the
   sloping edge (handled upstream by junction emission rules).

2. **Junctions / aprons / terminals get RING + ALL-PAIR Euclidean
   spatial edges (no radius cap).**  These are multi-directional
   surfaces — a plane can taxi across in any direction, so the
   role's grade cap applies between any two vertices on the same
   polygon, not just ring-adjacent ones.  The legacy 60 m radius
   cap was the source of the F-stub-vs-runway grade violation
   (user 2026-05-03): a junction wider than 60 m had un-constrained
   vertex pairs that ended up at incompatible elevations.

3. **Terminals are SOFT, not HARD-anchored.**  Only runway corners
   (CIFP profile) are immutable.  Terminals enter the solver as
   soft nodes seeded from DEM-median, with a flatness constraint
   (all corners share one value, set to the iteration-average each
   pass).  The pre-solver "max grade-compliant from runway corners
   within 250 m" terminal pin is intentionally bypassed when this
   solver runs.

Cross-shape continuity uses shape-shared vertex buckets (same node
index in the unified graph), which makes elevation continuity at
shared corners automatic.
