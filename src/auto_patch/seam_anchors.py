"""Insert seam vertices at integer lat/lon tile-boundary lines.

For each pavement shape whose polygon's exterior boundary crosses an
integer latitude or longitude line within the airport footprint, this
module:

  1. Inserts new ring vertices at the crossing points (deterministic
     from polygon geometry alone, independent of which tile is being
     built — both tile builds produce the same vertices).
  2. Converts sloped 4-corner rects to ``node_altitudes`` representation
     so each vertex (including seam crossings) carries its own altitude.
  3. Records the seam-vertex bucket keys in
     ``layout._seam_anchor_keys`` for the Phase-2 elevation solver to
     HARD-anchor against ``dem.alt_strict``.

Cross-tile parity: each tile build runs over the same pavement
geometry, finds the same cut lines, and inserts vertices at the same
(x, y) positions.  Phase-2 then samples the same SRTM pixel at each
seam vertex (SRTM .hgt overlap row), so all tile builds compute the
same altitude.  ``cut_layout_at_tile_boundaries`` then keeps only the
shape pieces falling in the current tile.

    the canonical 4-corner [HI-LEFT, LO-LEFT, LO-RIGHT, HI-RIGHT]
    ring convention (or equivalent CCW rotation), and EVERY
    downstream pass that operates on rects assumes 4 corners
    (absorption, junction-rule tests, ``_collect_junction_axes``,
    sloping-edge identification).  Inserting seam vertices into a
    sloping edge breaks that assumption: even a vertex collinear
    with its neighbours produces 5- or 6-corner rings that the
    rest of the pipeline rejects.

    Splitting the rect at each seam produces N + 1 sub-rects, each
    still 4-corner.  Sub-rect altitudes are intentionally left

    HARD-anchoring the seam corners (recorded in ``anchor_keys``)
    to ``dem.alt_strict``.
