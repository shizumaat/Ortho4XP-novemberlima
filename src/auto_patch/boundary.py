"""Airport boundary ribbon + boundary→DEM bridge polygons.

Two emitters:

* ``_emit_airport_boundary_shape`` — closed-ring airport boundary
  shape that wraps the union of all emitted airside pavement,
  used by downstream consumers to clip terrain underlay.
* ``_emit_boundary_dem_bridge`` — wedge polygons that bridge the
  airport boundary to the surrounding DEM where the airport sits
  noticeably above or below the natural terrain (CYXY's plateau,
  HECA's berm), preventing visual cliffs.

    Per user 2026-04-28: an airport-perimeter "ribbon" with
    controlled per-vertex altitudes provides the elevation
    transition between the airport's pavement and the surrounding
    DEM.  Vertices within ``runway_clamp_radius_m`` of any runway
    are clamped to the runway elevation ± ``runway_clamp_grade``
    × distance (default 3 % grade); vertices beyond the radius
    follow the DEM directly.

    Implementation:
      1. Buffer the boundary's exterior LineString by
         ``strip_half_width_m`` to produce a closed strip polygon.
         The strip naturally has an interior ring (the airport
         interior shrunk inward by the buffer).
      2. Decompose the holed strip into simple non-holed pieces
         via ``_decompose_polygon_with_holes`` so X-Plane's patch
         parser (which drops interior rings) renders the strip
         correctly.
      3. For each piece, densify boundary segments to
         ``densify_step_m`` so per-vertex altitude clamping
         resolves at a useful spatial frequency.
      4. Compute per-vertex altitudes against the runway-distance
         rule + DEM.
      5. Append each piece as a ``ROLE_BOUNDARY`` BuiltShape.

    where the boundary's clamped altitude differs from the raw DEM
    by more than ``gap_threshold_m``.

    Per user 2026-04-28: when the boundary ribbon is forced (by the
    runway-distance clamp at ≤ 3 % grade) to a value that disagrees
    with the natural terrain DEM by > 5 m, X-Plane renders a
    valley/cliff between the 5 m boundary ribbon and the surrounding
    terrain inside the airport perimeter.  The bridge polygon is a
    larger transition strip whose OUTER edge sits on the airport
    perimeter at the boundary's clamped altitude and whose INNER
    edge sits ``bridge_depth_m`` further inside the airport at the
    raw DEM altitude.  Per-vertex altitudes interpolate linearly
    between the two edges, giving X-Plane a gradual surface to
    descend / ascend over instead of a single hard step.

    OUTSIDE the airport boundary X-Plane keeps falling directly to
    DEM (no bridge needed there) — the user explicitly scoped this
    feature to the interior side only.

    Implementation:
      1. Densify the airport-boundary line to ≤ ``densify_step_m``.
      2. For each densified vertex, sample raw DEM and the
         runway-clamped altitude (same rule as the 5 m ribbon).
         Mark vertex if |gap| > ``gap_threshold_m``.
      3. Group consecutive marked vertices into "bridge runs"
         (with a 1-vertex slack so isolated unmarked vertices in
         the middle of a long gap don't split the run).
      4. For each run, build an inward-offset polygon
         (``bridge_depth_m`` inward from the boundary line) and
         clip it against any existing pavement / boundary ribbon.
      5. Emit per-vertex altitudes: outer edge = clamped, inner
         edge = DEM, with shape vertices on the boundary side
         tagged ``clamped`` and inner-edge vertices tagged DEM.
