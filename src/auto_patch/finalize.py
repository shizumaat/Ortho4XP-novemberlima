"""Post-phase-1 finalisation: phase-2 elevation + feature emit.

Run after ``pipeline.build_airport_pavement`` has emitted the
phase-1 geometry layout (rects, junctions, terminals, runways).
Performs:

* Phase-2 elevation solve via ``elevation._compute_elevations``.
* Geometry repair passes (shared-vertex enforce + overlap clip)
  to handle subdivisions / decompositions the elevation step may
  have introduced.
* Junction-altitude reconciliation (snap-to-rect-corner +
  shared-vertex average + within-junction adjacent-pair grade
  smoother).
* Final WARN summary of within-shape grade violations.
* Feature emit: airport boundary, groundside pavement, boundary→DEM
  bridges; bridges + tunnel portals when ``EMIT_BRIDGES_AND_TUNNELS``.
