"""Shared-vertex enforcement and snap helpers.

Geometric-invariant utilities used after every shape-build pass to
enforce the "Shared vertices exact between adjacent shapes" rule
(memory: feedback_shape_rules.md, Coverage invariants).  These
functions run as a finalisation layer that walks every emitted
PavementLayout shape and snaps near-coincident vertices to the
same coordinate, drops spike vertices that would self-intersect
under .11f OSM precision, and validates that adjacent shapes share
exact corners.

    *corner* with an adjacent junction polygon — never a point on
    one of its four edges.  Edge-interior coincidence breaks the

    constraint at a non-corner location.

    The runway-crossing-junction emit (``_resolve_runway_crossings``)
    builds a junction polygon from the union of crossing runway

    boundary intersection point; some of those points land 2-5 m
    *along* a surviving rect's long edge instead of *at* the rect's
    corner because the dropped (in-crossing) and surviving (out-of-

    share a vertex with a taxi rect ONLY at one of the rect's 4
    corners.  A junction vertex landing on the INTERIOR of a rect
    edge would split that edge at render time and break the rect's
    altitude_high/altitude_low slope convention.

    Per user 2026-04-29: junctions and taxiway/stub/runway rects
    should be handled the SAME WAY as runway-runway crossings —
    the junction should connect to either the LOW or HIGH short
    edge of a rect (i.e. its corners), never to the rect's edge
    interior.

    Two-stage policy applied to every junction ring vertex:

      Stage 1 — collapse redundant edge-interior vertices.
        If a vertex lies on the interior of a rect edge AND its
        ring-adjacent neighbours are both at corners of the SAME
        rect (one each, on the two ends of THAT edge), the vertex
        is redundant.  The junction's ring already connects the
        two corners; the intermediate vertex just splits a single
        rect edge into two pieces.  Drop the vertex — the junction
        edge then runs corner-to-corner along the rect's short
        edge (HIGH-side or LOW-side) cleanly.
      Stage 2 — corner snap / push for survivors.
        For each remaining vertex:
          * Within ``corner_tol_m`` of a rect corner ⇒ snap to
            that corner.
          * Within ``edge_tol_m`` of a rect edge interior ⇒ push
            ``edge_gap_m`` perpendicular outside the rect.
          * Otherwise ⇒ leave alone.

    Geometric only: doesn't touch elevations.  Runway corners are
    treated identically to taxi rect corners so junction vertices
    snap there too — the user's "same logic for all runway
    intersections" requirement.

    Returns the number of junction polygons modified.
