"""Emit one apt.dat taxiway polygon as a chain of sloping rectangles.

A taxiway polygon is a long, thin strip of pavement.  The previous
code triangulated every taxiway along with the apron, producing
dozens of small triangles where a simple chain of 2-3 sloped rects
would describe the same surface more precisely and match the user's
mental model — "almost all taxiways, except for intersections,
should be either flat or a sloping rectangle".

Pipeline:

1. **Fit a min-rotated bounding rectangle** to the polygon.  If the
   polygon fills less than ``min_fit_ratio`` of its MRR (default
   0.80), the shape is too irregular to approximate as a chain of
   rectangles and ``build_taxiway_rects`` returns ``None`` so the
   caller falls back to triangulation.

2. **Densely sample DEM along the long axis.**  Sample spacing is
   set by ``sample_spacing`` (default 20 m).  A 400 m taxiway yields
   21 samples.

3. **Grade-clamp the sample profile.**  Two passes: (a) longitudinal
   cap so ``|z[i+1]-z[i]| ≤ max_grade * dx`` everywhere; (b)
   rate-of-change cap at the FAA taxiway rule of one percent of
   grade change per 30 m, i.e. ``max_dg_per_m = 1/3000``, to stop
   an adjacent-segment kink from violating vertical-curve smoothness.
   The two caps alternate until convergence.

4. **Ramer-Douglas-Peucker simplification** on the clamped (t, z)
   profile with ``fidelity_tol`` tolerance (default 0.3 m).  The
   result is the minimum set of break-points whose piecewise-linear
   reconstruction stays within tolerance of every sample.  For a
   uniformly-sloped taxiway this collapses to ONE segment spanning
   the whole polygon; for a taxiway with a local dip it might
   produce two or three segments.

5. **Emit one sloping rectangle per simplified segment.**  The
   rectangle is aligned with the MRR long axis and has full MRR
   short-side width, so adjacent rectangles share an exact edge.

Each returned :class:`TaxiwayRect` has its 4 meter-space corners
laid out so ``[0, 1]`` is the high-elevation end and ``[2, 3]`` is
the low-elevation end, matching the ``altitude_high``/``altitude_low``
convention used by the legacy runway patch emitter.

This module is pure: no I/O, no shared state.  Tests in
``tests/test_taxiway_rects.py``.

    """Build one sloping rect per STRAIGHT segment of a centerline.

    The centerline is typically a Ramer-Douglas-Peucker simplified
    Voronoi skeleton path; its consecutive vertices are therefore
    already guaranteed to represent straight runs of the taxi
    polygon.  We emit exactly ONE rect per consecutive-vertex
    segment — no uniform sub-sampling — so a long straight taxiway
    collapses to a single rect regardless of length.

    User directive: "we can use between 25-30 rectangles to cover
    all the taxiways, excluding junctions", and "our shapes may
    go beyond the bounds of the apt.dat pavement by a small
    amount if needed to simplify coverage".  This function
    therefore uses the MAX of local-width probes (not the min or
    median) plus a small outward padding so each rect fully
    covers its segment of the taxi polygon — the rect can
    overflow into adjacent pavement by a few metres, which
    downstream apron/junction emission subtracts.

    Grade clamping + RDP on the elevation profile is still
    applied (so a 500 m rect with a 3 m DEM bump in the middle
    splits into 2 rects at the bump), but the segmentation
    floor is the CENTERLINE's own vertex count — the longest
    possible rect per centerline vertex pair is emitted.

    Args:
        centerline: shapely ``LineString`` in meter space, from
            :func:`O4_Taxiway_Skeleton.extract_centerlines`.
        polygon: the source taxiway polygon.
        sample_dem: ``(x, y) → elevation_m | None``.
        max_grade: longitudinal grade cap (default 1.5 % for
            taxiways).
        seg_length: DEM sample spacing along the centerline for
            grade clamping (not related to rect length any more).
        fidelity_tol: RDP tolerance for elevation-profile splits.
        max_dg_per_m: vertical-curve rate-of-change cap.
        min_width_m / max_width_m: if the computed width of a
            segment is below min_width_m the segment is dropped;
            above max_width_m it is clamped.
        max_rect_length_m: 0 disables any hard length cap (the
            default — let centerline vertex spacing determine
            rect length).  A positive value still splits any
            vertex-to-vertex segment exceeding the cap as a
            safety for extreme centerlines.
        runway_polygon / runway_elev_lookup: runway endpoint
            anchoring, unchanged from the previous version.

        A list of :class:`TaxiwayRect` or ``None`` if the
