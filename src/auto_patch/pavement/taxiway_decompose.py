"""Decompose a multi-taxiway apt.dat pavement polygon into strips.

X-Plane's ``apt.dat`` format lets a single pavement row describe
arbitrary geometry, and custom scenery packs routinely abuse this
by concatenating an entire network of taxiways into ONE polygon.
At SPJC the "Taxiway V / U / Q / R / L / M" row is an 857 929 m²
blob containing six named taxiways plus their cross-connectors;
"Taxiway Aux B, C, D, E, F, G" is another 160 284 m² multi-blob.
These never fit a single minimum-rotated-rectangle well enough to
be emitted as a clean rect chain, so :mod:`O4_Taxiway_Rects` alone
falls back to apron triangulation — which is the behaviour that
leaves mega-polygons as dense triangle meshes instead of the
handful of rects the user asked for.

The fix is to **decompose** the mega-polygon into individual
strip components, rect-chain each one, and hand the junction
residue (the "hub" where multiple strips meet) back to the apron
triangulator, since a multi-axis junction legitimately needs
triangles.

Algorithm — morphological open-minus decomposition:

1. ``core = polygon.buffer(-half_width).buffer(+half_width)``.  This
   is the "erode-then-dilate" morphological opening: it keeps
   anything wider than ``2 * half_width`` and erases anything
   thinner.  In practice ``core`` is the junction hub — the wide
   regions where strips cross each other or meet a terminal apron.
2. ``branches = polygon - core``.  What's left is the "strip" part
   — the long thin arms of the polygon.  Breaking this into
   connected components via ``unary_union(...).geoms`` gives one
   polygon per strip branch.
3. **Trim each branch** by unioning back the 1 m of ``core`` that
   borders it.  Without this the branch ends abruptly at the
   junction boundary, leaving a visible elevation seam where the
   strip rect meets the hub triangles.  A 1 m expansion gives the
   rect chain a shared vertex with the hub.
4. **Strip-fit check** — each branch is re-tested for MRR fit
   ratio; branches that still fail (e.g. an L-bend inside a single
   connected region) are marked for triangulation.

Returns :class:`Decomposition` with three lists:

* ``strip_polygons`` — disjoint branches suitable for
  :func:`O4_Taxiway_Rects.build_taxiway_rects`.
* ``junction_polygons`` — the ``core`` polygons plus any
  MRR-fit-failing branches, which the caller should triangulate.
* ``used_decomposition`` — ``True`` if morphological opening found
  a non-empty ``core`` (i.e. this is a multi-strip polygon),
  ``False`` if the polygon was already a simple strip and should
  be tried directly with :func:`build_taxiway_rects`.
