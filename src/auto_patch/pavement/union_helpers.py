    """Simplify a pavement polygon: drop sub-``tol`` detail and snip
    sliver-tip corners.

    Per user 2026-05-05: pavement should never have nodes closer than
    1 m, and X-Plane's mesh builder crashes on sub-``SLIVER_ANGLE_
    THRESHOLD_DEG`` (2°) corner spikes.  Apt.dat polygons routinely
    contain both: over-resolved curves stored as 100s of sub-meter
    steps, and 1° needle-tip features that look like real pavement
    tabs but were just floating-point doubled vertices in the
    source data.

    Two passes:

    1. **Douglas-Peucker simplify** (shapely's ``.simplify(tol,
       preserve_topology=True)``).  Drops verts whose perpendicular
       distance to the simplified edge is < ``tol``.  Eliminates
       over-resolution and most close-pair noise.  Preserves
       polygon topology.

    2. **Sliver-tip removal.**  After simplify, any remaining
       vertex with interior angle < ``SLIVER_ANGLE_THRESHOLD_DEG``
       is snipped; the two flanking vertices are joined directly,
       collapsing the needle into a chord.  Iterates so a freshly
       exposed sliver after one drop gets caught on the next pass.

    Returns the simplified polygon (Polygon or MultiPolygon, same
    type as input).  Falls back to the input on any failure.
