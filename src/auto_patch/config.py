# Per user 2026-05-04: bumped 10 m → 20 m to match the runway snap
# (RUNWAY_ADJACENCY_TOL_M).  10 m left vertices like SPJC junction
# -10153's v5 (17.88 m perpendicular to V3's edge) outside the snap

# junction's joining edge that needs to widen out to the next
# runway node.
#
# Bumped 5 m → 20 m per user 2026-05-04: any junction vertex within
# 20 m of the runway boundary should snap 1:1 to a runway segment
# corner — no extra nodes floating near the runway.  The 5 m band

# Ortho4XP cuts each SLOPED pavement way into ``cell_size``-metre cells
# (``cuts_long = way_length / cell_size``) and interpolates altitude with
# ``profile`` ("spline" or "plane").  This INTERNAL CUT GRID — not the
# patch's vertex count — drives the airport mesh's triangle count, and
# thus X-Plane load time (HECA measured: cell_size=2 m → +2.24 M
# triangles, 75% of the whole tile, 9m40s load vs 39s without the patch).
#
# A 4-corner sloping rect is a flat tilted PLANE, so a cell_size ≥ the
# way length yields ZERO internal cuts and renders the identical surface
# with a fraction of the triangles.  Runways differ: they carry a real
# FAA vertical profile (crests/sags), so coarsening them too far flattens
# that curve — hence a separate knob.
#
# To find the optimal compromise, sweep these and measure each build with
# ``tools/mesh_region_tris.py`` (triangle count) + the X-Plane load time.
# Historical default 2 m carried a "KBNA finding" note (smooth runway
# vertical transitions) — raise the runway value cautiously.
