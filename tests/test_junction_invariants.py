"""Junction polygon invariants — recurring-regression guards.

The user's authoritative shape rules (memory:
``feedback_shape_rules.md``) say:

* Junction polygons are the *residue* between rects / aprons /
  runways / terminals.  They are inherently small — incoming-corner
  count plus ≤ 4 trace points per arc between consecutive incoming
  corners.  Above ~5,000 m² the residue is apron-sized and should
  be classified as ``role=apron`` instead.
* "Coverage invariants → Shared vertices exact": every neighbour
  vertex that lands on a junction's perimeter must coincide with
  one of the junction's own ring vertices.  Otherwise X-Plane sees
  a free elevation gap at the kiss point and renders a cliff.

The CYXY ``-10070`` regression that prompted these tests had all
three failure modes at once: 32,000 m² area, 80 ring vertices, and
only 3 of its perimeter points shared with neighbouring shapes.

Each test parametrises across the standard test airports.  A
session-level layout cache avoids rebuilding the same airport for
every test.
