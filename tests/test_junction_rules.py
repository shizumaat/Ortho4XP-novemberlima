"""Junction-refinement rule regression tests (user 2026-05-01).

One test per rule defined in
``/Users/noah/.claude/plans/kind-meandering-sifakis.md``.  Each test
counts violations and fails when the count exceeds a per-airport
regression baseline.  Initial baselines are zero — emission passes
should leave no violations.

Implementation phase order: Rule 2 → Rule 1 → Rule 4 → Rule 3.
Tests for un-implemented rules are placeholders that skip until
their emission pass lands.
