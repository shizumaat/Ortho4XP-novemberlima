"""Regression tests for terrain-following elevation (user 2026-05-02
and 2026-05-03).

The current unified Laplacian solver propagates elevation from
runway HARD anchors outward through the pavement graph at
1.5 % / 1.0 % per-edge caps, which OVER-FLATTENS surfaces whose
natural terrain elevation is significantly above the runway.

These tests assert the elevation pipeline produces taxi/apron
elevations within striking distance of the local DEM, not collapsed
toward the runway.

See ``docs/elevation_solver.md`` for the redesign plan.
